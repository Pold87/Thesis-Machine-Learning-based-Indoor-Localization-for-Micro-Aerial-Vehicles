The approach was used in absolute localization for UAVs: \citet{blosch2010vision} employ the approach on a $3.5\,m \times 2\,m$ area and achieve a root mean square (RMS) positional error below $10\,cm$ in $x,y,z$-direction. Their calculation are done on a powerful ground station, which is connected to the UAV with a USB cable. While subsequent research has brought the algorithm on board of the UAV, the required processing power is still to complex for small MAVs.
