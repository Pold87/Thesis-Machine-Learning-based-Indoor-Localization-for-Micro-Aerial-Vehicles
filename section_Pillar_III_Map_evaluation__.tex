\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation}
\label{sec:syntheticdatageneration}

In the scope of this thesis, an application to simulate different
camera positions during flight was created. It generates synthetic
image patches based on perspective transformations of a map
image. Examples of generated images are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:montage}. The application allows for comparing and
predicting the performance of different maps. The software is written
in C++ and OpenCV~3.0.0.

The software is able to generate a specified amount of image patches
using random values for rotational angles, translational shifts, as
well as blur, contrast and brightness intensity. The values are
sampled from different probability distributions, see
Table~\ref{tab:distributions} for a summary. An additional graphical
user interface (GUI) displays the result of applied transformations
and saves the generated images.

To simulate camera movements in 3D space, a 2D to 3D projection of the
image is performed first. Then, by building separate rotation matrices
$R_x$, $R_y$, and $R_z$ around the axes $x$, $y$, and $z$, the
rotations can be performed separately. Next the rotation matrix $R$ is
created by multiplying the separate matrices, i.e.,
$R = R_x \times R_y \times R_z$. The 3D translation matrix is
multiplied by the transposed rotation matrix. This step is crucial to
rotate the \emph{camera model} and not the image itself. Finally,
after performing all steps, a projection from 3D space to 2D is
applied, to obtain the transformed image.
