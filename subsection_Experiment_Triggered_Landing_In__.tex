\section{Experiment -- Triggered Landing}

In the triggered landing experiment, the UAV was programmed to land as soon as its position estimates are in the landing zone. The landing zone was defined as a cirlce with a radius of $60\,cm$. The $x,y$-coordinate of the center of the circle was specified in the flight plan. A safety criterion based on the variance of particles was introduced, such that the landing is only performed if the criterion holds. The criterion parameter was set to 60\,cm in both $x-$ and $y$-direction. The experiment was conducted on a $5m \times 5m$ map and the ground truth was based on the position data from the motion tracking system. The training dataset was composed of 500 images recorded at an height of approximately 1\,m, recorded in the time span of one hour before the experiment.
