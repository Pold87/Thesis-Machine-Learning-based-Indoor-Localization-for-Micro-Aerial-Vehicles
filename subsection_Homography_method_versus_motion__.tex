\subsection{Homography method versus motion tracking system}
\label{sec:siftvsoptitrack}

In this analysis, the homography method is compared with the ground truth position estimates from the motion tracking system. The ground truth is measured with $cm$-accuracy. A map was created by stitching 445 images. The images were recorded during a 35 seconds flight. To ensure that the images are approximately aligned with the $z$-axis, a maximum roll angle of 4 degrees was set in the UAV configuration. 

To align the pixel coordinates of the homography method with the $cm$-coordinates of the motion tracking system, the approach in Section~\ref{sec:mapping} was used. The mean difference in $x$ and $y$-direction will be reported, as well as the standard deviation of the difference.
