This chapter will discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches for indoor localization and
contrast them to the proposed method. Important
background knowledge for later chapters, concerning feature detection,
image matching, and textons will be introduced. While the range of methods for indoor localization is wide-spread---from laser range scanners over depth cameras to RFID tag based localization---only methods that are closely related to the proposed approach are discussed. In detail, this means that the approach should be based on a monocular camera.
