This opens the door for improving the proposed
algorithm by changing the map. On the basis of desired characteristics
of a given map, an evaluation technique was developed that determines
the suitability of an environment for the proposed approach. This
technique allows for spotting distant regions with similar image
features, which could lead to deteriorated performance. The evaluation
can be performed using a given map image or recorded images during
flight. In the former case, synthetic images will be generated from
the map image that simulate images taken during flight.

The goal is to estimate $x,y$-coordinates in real-time and on-board of the UAV. It is assumed that the UAV flies at a approximately constant height, such that the estimation of height is not necessary.  It is intended to further reduce the size of MAVs to that of an
insect, hence necessitating lightweight and scalable position
estimation algorithms.
