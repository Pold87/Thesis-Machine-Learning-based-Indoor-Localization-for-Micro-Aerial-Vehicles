The goal is to estimate $x,y$-coordinates in real-time and on-board of the UAV. It is assumed that the UAV flies at an approximately constant height, such that the estimation of height is not necessary.  It is intended to further reduce the size of MAVs to that of an
insect, hence necessitating lightweight and scalable position
estimation algorithms. Figure~\ref{fig:highleveloverview} summarizes the proposed algorithm.
