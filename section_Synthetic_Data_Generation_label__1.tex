\section{Synthetic Data Generation}
\label{sec:syntheticdatageneration}

Acquiring data for machine learning methods is usually time-consuming. A viable alternative seems to be the 
use of synthetic data. However, their applicability in real-world situations is still hindered by
the reality gap---the difference between simulations and
real-world situations. The gap can manifest itself in different
lighting conditions, resolutions, or blur or process noise, like wind,
or air resistance.
