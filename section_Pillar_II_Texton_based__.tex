\section{Pillar II: Texton-based Approach}
\label{sec:textons}

In this section, the core of the proposed algorithm, the
implementation of the proposed texton framework is described.  The
histograms of textons are used as features for the $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN) algorithm. The outputs of this regression technique
are possible $x,y$-coordinates for a given image.

In the following pseudo code, $M$ represents the number of particles,
$z_t^x$ the output of the texton framework at time $t$, and $f_t^x$
the estimated flow at time $t$.


Importantly, for generating the training dataset, no subsampling was
used. Therefore, the training dataset will not show any variance, if
the same images were used.
