\section{Experiment -- Motion tracking system for Stabilization, Texton-based Approach for estimation}
\label{sec:experiment4}

In this experiment, a fixed route was set using the ground control
station. While the stabilization and guidance were performed using
the motion tracking system, the position estimates were performed onboard
of the MAV using the texton-based approach. The Euclidean distances between the estimates of the motion tracking system and the texton-based approach
were measured separately for the $x$- and $y$-direction. The experiment uses the
particle filter and the textons only.
