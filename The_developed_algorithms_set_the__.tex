The developed algorithms set the stage for absolute localization in various
GPS-denied environments, such as homes, offices, or factory buildings. While the used platform for this project was the Parrot Bebop Drone, the characteristics of the proposed system generalize to smaller MAVs in a flexible and innovative way.
We hope that our indoor localization approach will
pave the way for various applications, such as delivery, search and
rescue, or surveillance to support human operators in everyday
life.
