The developed algorithms set the stage for localization in various
GPS-denied environments, such as homes, offices, or factory buildings. While the used platform for this project was the Parrot Bebop Drone,
it is a stepping stone for developing fly-sized aerial vehicles.
We hope that our indoor localization approach will contribute to
bridging the gap between engineering and artificial intelligence, and
pave the way for various directions, such as delivery, search and
rescue, or surveillance to support human operators in everyday
life. It addresses the theme of miniaturization and allows to use
smaller MAVs in a flexible and innovative way.
