Widespread possibilities make Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) flexible
platforms. However, in confined spaces, specific localization
techniques are needed, which require high precision, reliability, and
rigorous error handling to minimize risks for people and hardware. Due
to their small size, MAVs have limited processing power and cannot
fall back to standard localization techniques. To address this
issue, this thesis describes an efficient onboard localization
technique for estimating $x,y$-coordinates for MAVs using a machine
learning-based approach, within a known, modifiable indoor
environment.
