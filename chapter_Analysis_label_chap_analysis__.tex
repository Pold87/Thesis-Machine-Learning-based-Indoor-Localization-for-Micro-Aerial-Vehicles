\chapter{Analysis}
\label{chap:analysis}

In this chapter, the setup of the conducted experiments is
presented. We examine different parameter choices in Experiment~1 to 6
in on-ground experiments using recorded data. Afterward, the found
parameters are used to show the validity during flight in
Experiments~7 and 8. The experiments were conducted in TU Delft's
CyberZoo---an indoor flight arena of size $w \times l \times h = 10\,m
\times10\,m \times 7\,m$, with relatively constant lighting settings
due to primarily artificial lighting.

The choice of the parameters is dependent on the environment and the size of the training dataset. Therefore, there is no general optimal parameter. Instead, the parameters have to be adapted to the particular environment. Since the proposed algorithm is intended for known environments, this is always possible.
