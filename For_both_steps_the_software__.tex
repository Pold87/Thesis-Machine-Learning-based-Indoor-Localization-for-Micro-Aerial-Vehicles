For both steps, the software Agisoft
PhotoScan~\cite{agisoft2013agisoft} was used. The stitching process
can be time-consuming and error-prone. In some environments, an image
from a top view point can be taken capturing the entire area with
high-resolution camera, circumventing the need for stitching together
multiple images. Yet another method starts with an existing image and
modifies the environment accordingly---for example by painting the
floor or printing posters--to correspond to the image. In all cases,
we will describe the environment as \emph{map image}.
