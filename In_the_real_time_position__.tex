In the real-time position estimation experiment (Experiment XXX), the initial mean error was rather large: 130\,cm in $x$-direction and 90\,cm in $y$-direction. A more in-depth analysis revealed that the estimates of the particle filter were lacking behind the position estimates of the motion tracking system. This was due to the simple motion model of the particle filter that was based on Gaussian noise only.
