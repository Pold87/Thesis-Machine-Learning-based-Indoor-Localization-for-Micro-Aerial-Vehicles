The GUI displays the position estimate of the proposed framework, the
ground truth position based on OptiTrack, the texton histogram, the
Euclidean distances between OptiTrack and the system, the uncertainty
of the system, and the correlation between the uncertainty and the
Euclidean distance between the Optitrack and treXton estimates. The
GUI can be accessed using the \emph{Tool} menu in paparazzi.
