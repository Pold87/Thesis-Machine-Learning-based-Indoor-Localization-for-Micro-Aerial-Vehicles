\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows.
Chapter~\ref{chap:relatedwork} surveys existing indoor localization
approaches related to this thesis. In Chapter~\ref{chap:methods}, the
developed texton-based approach is presented and its components, the
$k$NN algorithm and the particle filter, are introduced. Details about
the synthetic data generation tool and map evaluation technique are
also given. Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis} describes the setup of the
on-ground and in-flight experiments. The results of the experiments
are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:results} and discussed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion}. Finally, we draw our conclusions and
indicate future research directions in Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}.
