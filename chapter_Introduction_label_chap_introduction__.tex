Many crimes over the last decades have been solved thanks to footage
captured by surveillance cameras. However, stationary cameras can be
easily manipulated or avoided once it is known where they are
located. One possible solution may be the use of micro aerial vehicles
(MAVs) for surveillance. To date, indoor employment of these vehciles
is still hindered by several limitations. The focus of this thesis is,
thus, the development of accurate and fast indoor localization for
MAVs combining computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Since precision, reliability, and rigorous error avoidance are crucial
for safe flight, autonomous indoor navigation of an MAV is a
challenging task. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for
outdoor usage can rely on the global positioning system (GPS), this system is
usually not available in confined spaces and would not provide
sufficiently accurate estimates in cluttered environments.
