In the world of automation, micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) provide unprecedented perspectives for domestic and industrial applications. They can serve as mobile surveillance cameras, flexible transport platforms, or even as waiters in restaurants. However, indoor employment of these vehicles
is still hindered by the lack of real-time positions estimates. The focus of this thesis is,
thus, the development of accurate and fast indoor localization for
MAVs combining computer vision and machine learning techniques.

%Many crimes over the last decades have been solved thanks to footage
%captured by surveillance cameras. However, stationary cameras can be
%easily manipulated or avoided once it is known where they are
%located. One possible solution may be the use of micro aerial vehicles
%(MAVs) for surveillance. To date, indoor employment of these vehicles
%is still hindered by several limitations. The focus of this thesis is,
%thus, the development of accurate and fast indoor localization for
%MAVs combining computer vision and machine learning techniques.
