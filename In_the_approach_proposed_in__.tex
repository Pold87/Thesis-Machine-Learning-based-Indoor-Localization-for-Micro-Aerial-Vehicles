In the approach proposed in this thesis, computational power will be
shifted to an offline training phase to achieve high-speed during live
operation. In contrast to visual SLAM frameworks, this project considers
scenarios in which the environment is known beforehand or can be even
actively modified. The environment is non-dynamic and planar, therefore, the UAV will make use of texture on the bottom or ceiling of the environment.
