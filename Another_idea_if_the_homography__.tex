Another idea---if the homography-based approach is used for
labeling---was to use the amount of detected keypoints ($K$) as confidence
value. However, again, no linear relationship between $K$ and the error in $x-direction$ ($X$) and the error in $y-direction$ ($Y$)
could be found (Figure~\ref{fig:cor_sim_confi}): $\rho_{K, X} = 0.10$, $\rho_{K, Y} = 0.01$.
