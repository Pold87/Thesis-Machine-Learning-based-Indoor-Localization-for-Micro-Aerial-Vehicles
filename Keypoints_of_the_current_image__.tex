Keypoints of the current image and the map image are detected and
described using the SIFT algorithm. The keypoint sets are further refined using Lowe's ratio test~\cite{lowe1999object}. This is followed by a matching
process, that identifies corresponding keypoints between both
images. The matching uses a 'brute-force' matching scheme and every keypoint is compared to every other keypoint. These matches allow for finding a homography between both
images. For determining the $x, y$-position of the current image, the
center of it is projected on the reference image using the homography
matrix. The pixel position of the center in the reference image can be
used to determine the real world position by transforming the pixel
coordinates to real-world coordinates, based on the scale factors
$C_x$ and $C_y$, with $C_x = \frac{width(R)}{width(I)}$ and
$C_y = \frac{height(R)}{height(I)}$, where $W$ is the real-world
representation and $I$ the digital pixel image. This yields a dataset
of images, labeled with $x, y$ coordinates and the number of
matches. This process already introduces noise into the dataset, depending on the quality of the keypoint matches.

% The $x,y$-positions are of different quality depending on the used technique: homography-based, poster-based, or motion tracking-based.
