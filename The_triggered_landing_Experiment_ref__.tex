The triggered landing (Experiment~\ref{sec:landing}) showed a high accuracy. While the majority of landings were triggered inside the landing zone, two out of the six landings were outliers. However, their distance to the landing area were rather small, with an average distance of 16\,cm. A comparison without the safety criterion, showed, that the criterion can have advantages.
