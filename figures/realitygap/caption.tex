Exemplifying the reality gap. \emph{Top left}: image patch generated using draug. \emph{Top
      right}: image patch taken with the MAV's camera after printing
    the patch. \emph{Below left}: texton image of the synthetic
    image. \emph{Below right}: Texton image of the real image. The
    texton images shows that corresponding regions get classified into
    different textons, resulting in different histograms. This makes
    the transfer from the synthetic data to the real world difficult.
