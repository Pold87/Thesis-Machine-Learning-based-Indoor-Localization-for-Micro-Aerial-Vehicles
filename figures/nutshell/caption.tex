\label{fig:highleveloverview}
The figure illustrates the proposed system from a high-level perspective. The current camera image of the UAV is used to extract an image feature vector---the texton histogram. The feature vector is forwarded to a machine learning model that uses a $k$-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to output $x,y$-position estimates. These estimates are passed to a particle filter, which filters position estimates over time and outputs a final position estimate (green circle). The expected loss shows regions in the map where a lower accuracy is expected. The average expected loss can be used as ``fitness value'' of a given map.
