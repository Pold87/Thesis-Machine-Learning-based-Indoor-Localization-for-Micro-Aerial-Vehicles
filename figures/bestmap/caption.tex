\label{fig:orthomap}
This figure shows
    the created orthomap of a rather texture-rich floor. It is
    stitched together using 100 single images and represents a
    real world area of approximately $10\times10$ meters. Image
    distortions, non-mapped areas, and slightly skewed seams at
    several points are visible.%
