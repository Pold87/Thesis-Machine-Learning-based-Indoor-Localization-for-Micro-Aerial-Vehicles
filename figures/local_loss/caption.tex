Heatmap colors shows losses per region (smoothed using a Gaussian filter). Ideal
    histogram similarity for a given position. Histograms taken at
    positions close to $\textbf{x} = (400, 300)$ should be similar to
    this histogram. The further away the position of a certain
    histogram, the lower the ideal similarity should be.
