\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

In this chapter, the results of the experiments are discussed with regards to accuracy, frequency, and future improvements. Afterward, in the General Discussion, the research questions are addressed and discussed.

The comparison between sub-sampling and full sampling (Experiment~\ref{sec:numtextons}) has shown that only a small part of the maximum amount of
samples suffices. In fact, $\frac{400}{640 \times 480} = 0.13\,\%$ of the maximum amount of smaples suffices to achieve cosine similarities between the texton histograms larger than $99\,\%$. This set the stage for
large speed-ups during live operation. Additionally, the technique allows for further speed-ups depending on the processing power of the platform at hand.
