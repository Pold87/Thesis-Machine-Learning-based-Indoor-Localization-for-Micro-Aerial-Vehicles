\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

In this chapter, the results of the experiments are discussed with regards to accuracy, frequency, and future improvements.

The comparison of the amount of samples with the average cosine
similarity has shown that only a small part of the maximum amount of
samples suffices to achieve similarities larger than $99\,\%$. In
fact, $\frac{400}{640 \times 480} = 0.13\,\%$. This set the stage for
large speed-ups during live operation. Additionally, it allow for further speed-ups depending on the processing power of the used
CPU.
