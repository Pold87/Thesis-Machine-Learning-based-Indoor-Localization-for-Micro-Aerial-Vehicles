% TODO: Compare particle filter with Kalman filter!!   

It often outperforms more sophisticated algorithms. A frequent critique regarding the $k$NN is its increasing computational complexity with an increasing size of the training dataset. However, its time complexity can be reduced by storing the training examples in an efficient manner, such as a binary tree structure. However, all of our training datasets were below 1000 images, resulting in fast predictions based on a list structure.
