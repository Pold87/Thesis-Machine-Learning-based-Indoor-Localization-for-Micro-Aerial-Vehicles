\section{Experiment -- Comparing different possible maps}

For the map comparison, 50 possible maps have been collected using the
search term `wallpaper' in Google's image search. This search term was
used, since it is (i) a general term, without any specific image
categories, (ii) wallpapers are likely to have a high resolution, and
(iii) wallpapers are likely to be visually pleasant since they
are often used as desktop backgrounds. The criteria for the images were that
their minimum resolution was $1920 \times 1080$. Images with a higher
resolution were converted to $1920 \times 1080$.  For each image, we
generated 1000 random image patches using the simulation method
described in Section~\ref{sec:draug}, followed by the histogram
extraction method. This yielded a labeled dataset of histograms and
corresponding positions. For each map, we determined the expected
overall loss based on the method described in
Section~\ref{sec:syntheticdatageneration}. The compared maps were then sorted
according to their estimated loss.

%Three of the compared maps---the
%best performing, the one with median performance, and the worst
%performing---were printed on A0 paper to test the performance in the
%real world.
