\subsection{Texton Dictionary Generation}
\label{sec:text-dict-gener}

For generating a suitable dictionary for a given environment, an
initial flight was performed. During this flight, 1000 randomly
selected image patches of size $w \times h = 6 \times 6$ were
extracted per image. In total, 100 images were used, resulting in
$100,000$ image patches, which were clustered to create a texton
dictionary. The resulting cluster centers---the prototypes of the
clustering result---are the textons~\cite{varma2003texture}. An
example of a learned dictionary can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:dictionary}.

Different situations require different textons and a different number
of them. The choice of these parameters is map-dependent, and we set
it to 20 textons for all maps.
