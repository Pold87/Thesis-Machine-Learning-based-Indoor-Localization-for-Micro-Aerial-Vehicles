\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:researchquestions}

The research questions addressed in this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Can 2D positions be estimated in real-time using a machine
  learning approach on a limited processor in a modifiable indoor
  environment?
%\item Is accurate real-world localization regression possible when the
%  training data comprises synthetic data only?
\item Can we predict the suitability of a given map for the proposed
  localization approach?
\end{itemize}
