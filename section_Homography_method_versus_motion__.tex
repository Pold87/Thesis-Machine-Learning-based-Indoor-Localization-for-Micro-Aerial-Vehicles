\section{Homography method versus motion tracking system}
\label{sec:exp:homovsopti}

Figure~\ref{fig:mapexp} shows the obtained map. In Figure~\ref{fig:flightpath} the estimates of the homography method and the motion tracking system are visualized. In Table~\ref{tab:homoerror}, the obtained error statistics are displayed.
